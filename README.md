Mini Challenge 2 - Add Two Numbers
The code will ask the user to input two numbers
It will then store those numbers as variables
It will finally print out the sum of the two numbers.

Peer review by :Reed Goodwin- Spent a solid few minutes spamming and such trying to break it, Its really well writen and has little room for erros, the code is tight. I like the way he did number validationa and i beleive he dould have done a little bit better making it look better in the console but otherwise its great!
